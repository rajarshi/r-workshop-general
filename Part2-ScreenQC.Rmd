Since qHTS data is loaded in to the database, we can access plate and curve data directly from R. However, this requires installation of some packages that depend on Oracle - for Windows users getting this working is non-trivial. In addition, it requires you to know some of the internal details of how manage qHTS data - this may be TMI! More importantly, direct access to the database is deprecated and so may not be available in the future.

As an example, lets examine plate summaries for a series of screens
```{r}
library(ROracle)
library(ncgchts)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)

con <- get.connection('hts', 'ncgc', 'probedb')
proto.names <- c('s-vhl-UOK102-1',
                 's-vhl-UOK109-1',
                 's-vhl-UOK121-1',
                 's-vhl-UOK121-2')

protos <- lapply(proto.names, function(p) {
  plates <- get.plates(con, p, type.index=0, layer.index=0)
})

aplate <- protos[[1]]
```
